\subsection{Interfaces to CODEC, SPORT and SPI}
Transfer of data between the ADC and memory, within memory spaces, and between memory and peripherals with DMA.

\subsubsection{CODEC}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A CODEC consists of both ADC and DAC with associated analog antialiasing and reconstruction low-pass filters.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 2 stereo ADC, 3 stereo DAC.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Operates in 16-, 18-, 20-, or 24-bit resolution.
		\end{itemize}
		\item TDM mode, 48-kHz sampling rate.
		\item I2S mode, 96 kHz sampling rate, only primary channels active.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{SPI}
One SPI provides high-speed serial communication of up to SCLK/4. It
interfaces with another processor, data converters, and display.
\begin{itemize}
	\item CODEC setup using SPI interface.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{SPORT}
Two synchronous serial ports (SPORT0 and SPORT1) provide high-speed
serial communication with a maximum speed of SCLK/2. This provides an
efficient interface with CODEC.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Receive clock (Internal or External)
	\item Transmission synchronized with CODEC
	\item Buffers to handle Rx and Tx data
	\item I2S mode is standard for stereo channels (L/R)
	\item TDM mode (Time Division Multiplex)
	\item Tansfers 8 channels in every frame
	\item Configuration: bits, DMA, interrupts, bit order
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ESP 7.1.2
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{I2S}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Three-wire serial	bus standard protocol.
	\item Two time slots for left and right channels.
\end{itemize}

	\label{fig:21}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{TDM}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Time-Division Multiplex Mode.
	\item Two ADC left channels (L0 and L1) and two right channels (R0 and R1) occupy slots \#1, \#2, \#5, and \#6 of ASDATA1.
	\item Six DAC channels occupy the six time slots of DSDATA1.
	\item Special TDM auxiliary mode allows	two external stereo ADCs and one external stereo DAC to be interfaced to form a total of eight input and eight output transfers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sample and Block Processing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Sample-by-Sample Processing}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Requires that all operations must be completed within the given sampling period.
		\item Latency of processing is the total time from the instant the data sample is read to the time the digital output is written to the memory.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $T_{in}$ = time needed for the processor to copy current sample from ADC into processor memory. Also includes program access time.
			\item $T_{sp}$ = time needed for processing current data samples. Duration depends on complexity of the algorithm and efficiency of the	program.
			\item $T_{out}$ = time needed to output the processed data to the DAC.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Overall overhead time for sample-by-sample processing is denoted as $T_{os}$.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Includes $T_{in}$ and $T_{out}$ and response time to interrupt.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Terminated processing before next sample/block. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $T_{sp} \leq T_s - T_{os}$
		\end{itemize}
		\item Advantages?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Predictable processing time ($T_s$).
			\item Delay between input and output within one sample.
			\item Low memory usage for storage will though increase for multichannel applications.
			\item Results are kept current within the sampling period.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Disadvantages?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Overhead of setup, access, interrupt for every sample.
			\item DSP must be fast enough to complete all task	before the arrival of next input sample.
			\item Not suitable for block based algorithms like Fourier transformation.
		\end{itemize} 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

	\label{fig:19}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Block Processing}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Samples are gathered in input buffer for N samples received
		\item Interrupt for every sample block of size N
		\item Block delay = $2\cdot N\cdot T_s$
		\item Doublet buffering for input and output samples
		\item DMA used to move data between SPORT and buffers (Sample buffer)
		\newpage \item Advantages?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Instruction cycle to compute a block of samples is shorter compared to sample-by-sample processing.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Disadvantages?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Memory of 4 buffers for holding input and output
			data samples.
			\item Block delay $2\cdot N\cdot T_s$.
			\item Complexity in programming switching between buffers.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The block processing system starts by sampling the first five input
samples from the ADC to form block \textit{i}. The system continues to sample another five data samples to form block \textit{i + 1}. At the same time, the processor operates on data samples in block \textit{i} and sends the five previously processed samples to the DAC. During the next block period, \textit{i + 2}, another five newer samples are acquired. The processor operates on the data samples in block \textit{i + 1} and outputs the processed data samples in block \textit{i}.

sDataBufferTX[INTERNAL_DAC_L0] = sCh0LeftOut;
sDataBufferTX[INTERNAL_DAC_R0] = sCh0RightOut;
sDataBufferTX[INTERNAL_DAC_L1] = sCh1LeftOut;

// Move data from receive buffer to local buffer
for (i = 0; i < INPUT_SIZE; i++)
{
	// Retrieve all the samples from receive buffer to process buffer
	sCh0LeftIn[i] = sDataBufferRX[INTERNAL_ADC_L0+j];
	sCh0RightIn[i] = sDataBufferRX[INTERNAL_ADC_R0+j];
	sCh1LeftIn[i] = sDataBufferRX[INTERNAL_ADC_L1+j];
	sCh1RightIn[i] = sDataBufferRX[INTERNAL_ADC_R1+j];
	// use the builtin circular buffer to update the index

}
Process_Data();
...
