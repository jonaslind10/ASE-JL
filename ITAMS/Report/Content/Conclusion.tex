A counting scale system has been implemented using a graphic display, a keypad and a load cell.
The user interacts with the system using a keypad. The graphic display shows a menu where it is possible to add new items to the system and start a counting. 
When adding a new item, the system stores it permanently.
The resolution of the system is \SI{1.35}{g} which could be improved.
