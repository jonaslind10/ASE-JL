\section{System Test}
The Counting Scale system is tested with different types of items and with different amount of the item.
The output from the system is held up against a reference weight scale with a resolution of \SI{1}{\gram} and a reference amount that is manually counted.

As seen in \cref{tab:results} it is possible to be 1 number from the true item amount. 
This could be because of the resolution of the ADC is \SI{1.35}{\gram}.
To obtain a better resolution for the system there are to main possibilities.
By increasing the gain, the dynamic range for the ADC will be used entirely and the resolution would improve. 
This would require reducing the offset.
Another solution would be to use a different ADC with a better resolution than the 10 bit ADC in the ATMega 2560.
