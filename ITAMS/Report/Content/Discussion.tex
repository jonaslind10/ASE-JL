A system that can count number of items placed on a scale has been implemented. 
The user can add new items to the system which is stored, even after the system has been turned off. 
An addition for the system could be the possibility to remove a stored item.

The load cell has a offset which has changed. 
An addition to the system could be a function that would measure the new offset and change the weight calculation.
 
The system has a resolution of \SI{1.35}{\gram} which is problematic when a single item has a weight less than this. 
Increasing the gain would improve the resolution by using the entire dynamic range of the ADC.
This would require the offset should be reduced as it also is being amplified. 
If the offset is reduced to \SI{150}{\milli\volt}, the ADC could still use single supply. \cite[p.~12]{ATmega2560}
If the offset become less than this, a negative supply for the ADC would be needed.
Changing the ADC to another ADC with a higher resolution than the ATMega 2560 10 bit ADC could also be a solution. 

The user interface for the system is implemented with a keypad and a LCD. 
The keypad takes user inputs and the LCD displays the system menu. 
An improvement to the system would be implementing the entire user interface with the LCD. 
The keys would be implemented using the LCD as a touch screen instead of the separate keypad.
