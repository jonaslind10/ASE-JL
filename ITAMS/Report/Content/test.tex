\section{Debugging Tools}
Two different tools have been used to test the different parts of the system. 
The Atmel ICE debugger has been used to debug and test the system using JTAG. 
It has in particular been used to test the menu system and the changing of the menu states depending on the input. 
It has the advantage of being able to use break points while running the program. 
Other tests of the different parts has mainly been done using the UART port to output the interesting results.
